[Header:] Sun Avoidance Skill Leaderboard

[A table with three columns, all with underlined headers.]

<u>Rank</u>

<u>Mission</u>

<u>Sun Nearest Miss</u>

[First 'row', 'Rank', is of extra height and over several lines, using vertical and horizontal ellipses between the two endpoints to indicate a range of ranks in the first column, the first visible digit of the larger number being cut off by the left frame edge:] 1. ⋮ … ⋮ 4303857.

[Across both the 'Mission' and 'Sun Nearest Miss' columns, the first row has some text spread across two lines, within a framing pair of large square brackets to match the Rank range:] All other expeditions in human history

[A simple row, with all three columns separately populated, the first column's Rank number is also cut off across the first visible digit.]
