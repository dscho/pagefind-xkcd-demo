[A two-masted sailing ship with its sails up is floating on a calm sea with tiny waves. Two tiny figures can be seen at the ship's bow. One of them is speaking. In the next panel it becomes clear this is the captain.]

Captain: I hope someday someone invents a way to sail upwind.

Captain: Using the kedging cannon just wastes so much gunpowder.

[Close-up on the deck of the ship, showing two persons behind the taffrail. Cueball is standing behind the ship's captain and talking to him. The captain is wearing a black bicorne navy hat and aiming a cannon containing an anchor forward. Chains are draped from the cannon.]

Cueball: The ***what?***

Cueball: Wait, do you not know how to sail upwind? Is that why your ship takes forever to--

Captain: Stand by...***Fire!***

[Distant shot showing the anchor and its chain being launched out in front of the ship, towards the right of the panel. Cueball and the Captain can still be seen behind the cannon. The cannon has exhaust fumes coming out in front and the sound it makes is indicated:]

Cannon: *Boom*

[Same setting but the anchor is now under water and the chain has become taut as the ship is dragged forward to the right. Movement lines behind the ship indicated its progress and it is also further into the frame than the previous panel. The movement is caused by pulling the chain back in on the ship. This produces a series of sounds:]

Dragging chain: *Click click click*
