Height above Earth's surface of the highest-altitude human over time

(very approximate)

[A line graph is shown, with frequent spikes on the line. The y-axis is a logarithmic scale from 1 meter to 1,000,000 km. The x-axis shows years from about 1710 to 2025.]

[Label between 1720s and 1780s, maximum height is roughly 100 meters:]

Various falls and hilarious catapult accidents

[Label with multiple arrows, from 1780s to 1910s, maximum height is roughly 10 km:]

Balloon flights

[Label with multiple arrows, from 1910s to 1960s, maximum height increases to roughly 100 km:]

Airplane flights

[Label with arrow, in the late 1960s, maximum height is roughly 500 km:]

Spaceflight

[Label with arrow, in the 1970s, maximum height is roughly 500,000 km:]

Apollo Program

[Label between 1990s and 2025, the average height after 2000 is roughly 500 km:]
