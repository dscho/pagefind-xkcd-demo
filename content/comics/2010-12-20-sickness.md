[The three panels are arranged diagonally, upper left to bottom right.]

[Two people, Cueball and White Hat, are walking past a tree.]

White Hat: So, has this sickness opened you up to looking for answers beyond science?

Cueball: ...no, not really.

[Cueball turns to face White Hat.]

Cueball: We've groped for comfort before the slings and arrows of fortune for millennia, and I begrudge nobody their sources of solace.

Cueball: But Science provides *tools*.

Cueball: $100 billion a year in scientific studies and medical R&D has bought us some pretty damn powerful slings and arrows of our own.

Cueball: This world is amazing, and I'm going to live to experience more of it thanks to people who refused to gracefully accept the ineffability of reality.

Cueball: I find my courage where I can, but I take my weapons from science.

Cueball: Because they *work*, bitches.
