[Cueball is walking in from the right holding a license plate up with both hands for an off-panel Megan to see. It is possible to see the plate, but here it looks like all I's (or 1's).]

Cueball: Check out my personalized license plate!

Megan (off-panel): "1I1-III1"?

Cueball: It's perfect!

Plate: III-IIII

[In this frame-less panel Megan is sitting in an office chair holding and looking at the plate while Cueball stand next to her rubbing his hands together in front of him.]

Cueball: No one will be able to correctly record my plate number!

Cueball: I can commit any crime I want!

Megan: Sounds foolproof.

[A man with hair only around his neg and glasses holds out a hand towards a bald male police officer with a black peaked cap with white emblem on the front. The police man interviews their witness holding a notepad and a pen. Another likewise caped female officer is Ponytail who walks to the left arm pointing left. There is a line of yellow police tape behind them with text partially obscured by the characters. At the top left of the panel there is a small frame with a caption:]

Soon:

Witness: The thief's license plate was all "1"s or something.

Police officer: Oh. *That* guy.

Ponytail: His address is on a post-it in the squad car.

Yellow strip (text not visible in brackets): Poli[ce strip] do not cross [poli]ce stri[p do not] cross.
