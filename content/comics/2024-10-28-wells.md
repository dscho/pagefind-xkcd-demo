[Megan is on the left hand side and is facing Cueball who is on the right side and facing her. Megan has her left hand raised.]

Megan: I need water, so I think I'll dig a deep hole and drink whatever liquid I find at the bottom.

Cueball: What will you do after you drink it all? Dig another hole?

Megan: I dunno. Hopefully it magically refills itself or something.
