[In a single comic panel that has a black background, there is a glowing green laser beam that starts in the upper left of the panel and ends near the lower right. An arrow in the label is pointing to a point that has spikes of green light glowing out. The label is in green and written alongside the laser beam.]

<u>Someone is committing a federal crime right here→</u>

[Caption below the panel:]
