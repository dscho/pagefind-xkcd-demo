  When Guitar Hero 2 comes out I'll have fresh conversational material for MONTHS.

[Megan and Cueball converse.]

Megan: What kind of music do you listen to?

Cueball: Oh, a mix of things. Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...

Megan: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.

Cueball: But there's some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.

Megan: Sometimes they're a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.

Cueball: Oh yeah—have you ever checked out Freezepop?

Megan: Mhm! Synth pop can be fun, but at the same time, I agree that sometimes you just need to blast some Metallica.

Cueball: Who?

Megan: ...Metallica.

Cueball: Are they new?

I sound pretty knowledgeable about music until people figure out that I'm just naming bands from Guitar Hero.
