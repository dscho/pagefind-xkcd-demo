  In my new scale, °X, 0 is Earths' record lowest surface temperature, 50 is the global average, and 100 is the record highest, with a linear scale between each point and adjustment every year as needed.

Temperature Scales

[A table with five columns, labelled: Unit, Water freezing point, Water boiling point, Notes, and Cursedness. There are eleven rows below the labels.]

[Row 1:] Celsius, 0, 100, Used in most of the world, 2/10

[Row 2:] Kelvin, 273.15, 373.15, 0K is absolute zero, 2/10

[Row 3:] Fahrenheit, 32, 212, Outdoors in most places is between 0–100, 3/10

[Row 4:] Réaumur, 0, 80, Like Celsius, but with 80 instead of 100, 3/8

[Row 5:] Rømer, 7.5, 60, Fahrenheit precursor with similarly random design, 4/10,

[Row 6:] Rankine, 491.7, 671.7, Fahrenheit, but with 0°F set to absolute zero, 6/10

[Row 7:] Newton, 0, 33-ish, Poorly defined, with reference points like "the hottest water you can hold your hand in", 7-ish/10

[Row 8:] Wedgewood, –8, –6.7, Intended for comparing the melting points of metals, all of which it was very wrong about, 9/10

[Row 9:] Galen, –4?, 4??, Runs from –4 (cold) to 4 (hot). 0 is "normal"(?), 4/–4

[Row 10:] *Real* Celsius, 100, 0, In Anders Celsius's original specification, bigger numbers are *colder*; others later flipped it, 10/0

[Row 11:] Dalton, 0, 100, A nonlinear scale; 0°C and 100°C are 0 and 100 Dalton, but 50°C is 53.9 Dalton, 53.9/50
