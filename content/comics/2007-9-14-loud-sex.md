My neighbor has loud sex.

[Cueball in bed, covering his head with a pillow. There is sound coming from outside.]

*OHHHHH*

*GASP*

*AAAAAAA*

Good for her and all, but it keeps me up at night.

And she's so smug about it.

[Cueball and neighbor coming out of their apartments.]

Neighbor: Sorry, could you hear us last night? Oh, you know how it gets sometimes.

Cueball: Not really...

But tonight I finally get my revenge. Because now I have a loud girlfriend too.

[Megan with "LOUD" and an arrow pointing to her.]

And an elliptical reflector dish.

[Cueball and Megan having sex, with the dish behind them reflecting the sex sound effects, in a way that they focus, through walls, on his neighbor sitting up in bed while holding her head in pain.]
