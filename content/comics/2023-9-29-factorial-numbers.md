  So what do we do when we get to base 10? Do we use A, B, C, etc? No: Numbers larger than about 3.6 million are simply illegal.

[Cueball is standing in front of a large presentation poster. There are two uniformed officers (a Ponytail and a further Cueball, wearing badged hats) approaching Cueball.]

[Poster:]

[Title:]Variable-base Factoradicâ„¢ numbers

[Diagram in the form of a slip of paper, left edge torn jagged to indicate indefinite continuation]

[Several stacked elements. Following the general pattern of having "Base" at the top a base-number below that, and a square below that holding a digit (less than the given base-number)]

[Rightmost stack:] Base 2 [square:] 1

[2nd rightmost stack:] Base 3 [square:] 1

[3rd rightmost stack:] Base 4 [square:] 1

[4th rightmost stack:] Base 5 [square:] 0

[5th rightmost stack:] Base 6 [square:] 5

[6th rightmost stack:] Base 7 [square:] 3

[Leftmost stack is cut across by the 'torn' edge of the diagram. Square seemingly contains a 0.]

[Two column-pairs, with idential paired-headers, above (generally) a 'number', a linking dash and another 'number']

[Left headers for both:] Base 10

[Right headers for both:] Factoradic

[First column of number pairs:]

1 &mdash; 1

2 &mdash; 10

3 &mdash; 11

4 &mdash; 20

5 &mdash; 21

6 &mdash; 100

7 &mdash; 101

[Gap]

21 &mdash; 311

22 &mdash; 320

23 &mdash; 321

[Continuation in second column of number pairs:]

24 &mdash; 1,000

25 &mdash; 1,001

[Gap]

5,038 &mdash; 654,320

5,039 &mdash; 654,321

5,040 &mdash; 1,000,000

[Gap]

999,998 &mdash; 266,251,210

999,999 &mdash; 266,251,211

1,000,000 &mdash; 266,251,220

1,000,001 &mdash; 266,251,221

Cueball: Small numbers like seven or nineteen shouldn't use big numerals like "7" or "9".

Cueball: I mean, "9" is the biggest numeral we have! It should be reserved for ***big*** numbers.

Cueball: Small numbers should be written with small numerals like "1" or "2".

Cueball: That's why my variable-base system uses...Hey! No, listen!

[Caption under the comic:] Factorial numbers are the number system that sounds most like a prank by someone who's about to be escorted out of the math department by security.
