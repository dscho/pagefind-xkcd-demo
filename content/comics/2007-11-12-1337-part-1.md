  If you're not cool enough to do it manually, you can look up tools like Upside-Down-Ternet for playing games with people on your wifi.

[Cueball talks to his Cueball-like friend who is lying down on the floor, using his laptop. Cueball is pointing at the laptop.]

Cueball: You're not on the neighbor's WiFi, are you?

Friend: Yeah, why?

Cueball: The admin... plays games.

Friend: No problem. I'll just hop on a secure VPN.

[Cueball's friend now sits on his knees in front of his laptop frantically typing. A message from the laptop comes out with a zig-zag line.]

Friend: Whoa, my connections are dying as soon as I start to tunnel anything!

Message on laptop: A VPN? How cute! And stop trying to SSH.

Friend: Holy shit! Someone's inserting notes into the pages I request! Editing the TCP stream live!

Friend: Nobody's that fast. Who *is* this admin?

[In a frameless panel, Mrs. Roberts with a hot bun tray in one hand (indicated with five wiggly lines above the buns), with oven mitts on both hands, typing on her desktop computer on a table.]

Mrs. Roberts: My goodness. Neighborhood scamps on the wireless.

*Taptaptaptap*

[Cueball is standing with a hand toward his now standing friend, the laptop lies between them.]

Cueball: I should have warned you about Mrs. Roberts.

Friend: How does she type with oven mitts!?

Cueball: You've been pwned pretty hard, man. You might want to sit down.
