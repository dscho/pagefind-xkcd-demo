[Cueball is talking with Megan.]

Cueball: I'm psychic, you know.

Megan: There's no such thing.

[In a frame-less panel they continue to talk.]

Cueball: Okay, think of a number from one to one hundred.

Megan: Okay.

Cueball: 43.

Megan: Holy shit!

[Cueball lifts one hand towards Megan.]

Cueball: I try not to let it affect my life too much.

Megan: Wait, I can't believe this.

[Cueball turns and walks away, but stretches his arm back out towards Megan, who is still just standing looking after him.]

Cueball: Don't worry about it. Forget I said anything.

Megan: But-

Cueball: Let's get to the movie.

Megan: I, uh... OK, sure.
