  The Fujita scale was replaced by the enhanced Fujita scale in 2007, but I think 'EF-5' sounds stupid, so I vote we just use the new measurements for assigning number but still call them 'F-whatever'.

[Two people are in a car, which is driving past a cactus. The passenger has a pith helmet and a mustache.]

Cueball: The tornado's three miles west, moving northeast at 15 mph.

Passenger: Go right; get ahead of it.

[A tornado is visible. The passenger pulls out a gun, and stands up in the car.]

Passenger: Okay, we're in range! Stop here!

[The passenger fires the gun at the tornado.]

*BANG*

Tornado: AUGH!

[The tornado is split in half by the bullet.]

Passenger: Big one! Must be an F-3!

Cueball: I'm not sure we're doing this right.

Passenger: Help me mount it on the hood.

[The passenger is holding the tornado by its tail.]
