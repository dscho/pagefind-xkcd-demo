[White Hat holding one hand up in front om him and Megan are walking together.]

White Hat: In *Jurassic World*, we've used genetic engineering to create a *better* dinosaur.

Megan: Tyrannosaurus is the most charismatic animal that ever lived, and you think you'll *upstage* it?

[White Hat now holds both his hands up in front of him as he and Megan walk on.]

White Hat: *Tyrannosaurus* was cool, but it's two decades old!

Megan: I think it's a *little* older than that.

[In this frame-less panel White Hat points up as they continue to walk.]

White Hat: We took *Tyrannosaurus* and we *improved* it. Made it scarier, deadlier, smarter.

White Hat: Lookâ€“there it is!

[Cueball and Megan are dwarfed in the bottom left corner as they stare up at a facsimile of the green T-Rex from *Dinosaur Comics*. They only reach T-Rex to it's knees.]
