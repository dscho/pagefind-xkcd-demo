[On a grey board, there are 23 Advent calendars behind large "windows", numbered from 3 to 25, plus two open calendars with their covers torn off.]

[Each calendar numbered *n* has 26âˆ’*n* squares in it.]

[One open calendar has 25 squares, 2 of which are black. The other open calendar has 24 squares, one of which is black.]
