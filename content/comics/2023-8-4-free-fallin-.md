[There is a map of San Fernando Valley, California, with a dotted line labeled “flight path” and several other features marked on and around the line. It must be assumed up is north, since there is no compass to indicate otherwise.]

[The emblem and name of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are in the in top left.]

[The dotted line labeled "Flight path" moves as such:]

\* Circled X labeled Tom Petty home near the center of Reseda, moving down below Ventura Boulevard.

\* The words "Flight path" are drawn, with an arrow pointing towards the line.

\* As the line moves below Mulholland Drive, it starts moving right.

\* The words "Glide phase" point to the path as it goes up, crossing Mulholland and Ventura once more.

\* Three loops are in the path. The first is labelled "Skywriting incident". It starts moving right here.

\* The flight path abruptly ends as an arrow pointing towards a question mark.

[There are some other features not directly correlated to the flight path.]

Boys (Bad)

There are 4 arrows coming out of this text. They all end up curving to go southwest.

Girls (Good) (Sad)

This is to the upper right of where the flight path starts. There are 7 arrows coming out of this text, heading straight.

Vampires

This is above Ventura Boulevard, in between the two times the flight path crosses Ventura. There are 3 "X"es in sequence on the road, and there is a single straight arrow above these, pointing along Ventura to the left.

[Caption below the panel:]

Due to an obscure law, if you download a song onto a flight data recorder and send it to the NTSB, they have to do a report on it.
