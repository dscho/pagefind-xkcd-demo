[A guy sits at a computer, while a friend takes a book off a shelf behind him.]

Computer guy: "Error -41"? That's helpful. It doesn't even say which program it's from!

Friend: -41? I'll look it up...

[In a frame-less panel, the friend looks at the book.]

Friend: It says -41 is: "Sit by a lake."

[The two walk.]

[The two sit down.]

[A large, in-color painting of a lake with pond lilies.]

[The two are still sitting.]

Computer guy: I don't know where you got that book, but I like it.

Friend: Hasn't been wrong yet.
