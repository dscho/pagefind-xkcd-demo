  Three headstones down, I got a call from my mom and it went from bad to worse.

[Cueball is in a cemetery, near a gravestone. Other people stand around staring. One Cueball-like figure stands to the right of him, and three figures, further away, look on as well. Of the three figures in the back, the tallest left-most Cueball-like figure covers his mouth with his hands. Megan is standing next to him, using her arm to block the view of a smaller figure to the right of her, presumably a child.]

Cueball: Frankly, you deserve this. You *knew* I wanted a sans-serif font, and you *ignored* me. So really, this is *your* fault.
