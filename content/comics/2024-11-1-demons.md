[Three demons, Cueball-like in general appearance but with horns and pointed tails, are standing together while surrounded by flames. The leftmost demon is holding a pitchfork and the next one has his hands down. They are looking at the third to the right standing a bit apart from them. This last demon, Maxwell's demon as given in the caption, holds his palms up while looking at the other two.]

Demon with pitchfork: What's our plan for the souls today? Boil them in oil?

Middle demon: We could cast them into the flame pit.

Maxwell's demon: What if we set up two rooms with a door in between, but– get this– ***we only let them go through it one way!***
