[Black Hat and a Hairy-like child are standing to the right of an empty sleigh pulled by a reindeer with eight spider-like legs. Black Hat has raised one arm towards the reindeer and the boy has his arms out to either side.]

Black Hat: In earlier Norse myths, the eight reindeer were actually one steed with eight *legs*.

Black Hat: So I think this is more authentic.

Hairy: *Aaaaaa!*
