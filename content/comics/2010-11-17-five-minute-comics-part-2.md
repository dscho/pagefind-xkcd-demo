  Dear Wiccan readers: I understand modern Wiccans are not usually all about the curses and hexes. But Darth Vader was recently converted from Episcopalianism and he's still figuring it all out.

Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends.  Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.

;Comic #1

[A ninja is hiding under a diving board as a man runs along it.]

[The man jumps on the end of the board and hits the ninja in the head, knocking him into the pool.]

[The ninja floats in the water. A bullet passes through the man's head.]

*thwipp*

[The man is lying bleeding on the diving board, the ninja is still unconscious on the pool.]

[A sniper is at the top of a hill. The sign in front of the hill says "Grassy Knoll".]

[Someone is pointing at the diagram of the previous panel.]

Off-panel voice: Wait, so *what* does this have to do with 9/11, again?

Cueball: I *said* I'm getting there!

;Comic #2

[Cueball is studying Megan.]

Cueball: You look different.

Cueball: You have this... <u>glow</u> about you.

[They stare in silence.]

[A baby falls out of Megan.]

*plop*

;Comic #3

Megan: Cogito ergo cogito.

Off-panel voice: Playing it safe, huh?

;Comic #4

[Two children dressed up as ghosts are standing in front of Megan at a door, each carrying a bag.]

Children: Trick or treat!

[Megan doesn't move.]

Child: Um hi. Why are you just standing there?

Other Child: Candy?

[Another silent panel as the children stare up at Megan.]

[The second child looks in their bag.]

Other Child: Oh God, my bag of candy.

Other Child: It's filling with blood.

Child: We should go.

;Comic #5

[A jet is flying across the panel.]

Pilot: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

[The pilot and copilot have buckets, and are bailing water out of the cockpit.]

;Comic #6

The following is a dramatization of real events.

[Cueball is at a counter, with several jars.]

Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'm making a sandwich! AAAAAAAAAA!

;Comic #7

[Two people are carrying lightsabers and wearing robes.]

Cueball: Oh God, my eyes won't focus right! And your robe looks... really dirty!

My blacklightsaber was not a success.

;Comic #8

[Cueball is standing.]

Cueball: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

Off-screen voice: It seems we happen to be all ladies, actually.

Cueball: ...in that case, this defense is going to appear <u>extremely</u> ill-advised.

;Comic #9

[Darth Vader is sitting between two people, at a table.]

Cueball: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't helped you conjur up the stolen data tapes, or given you—

Darth Vader: *HEY.* Wicca is a legitimate belief system!

[Darth Vader is drawing a pentagram on the table.]

Cueball: What are you—

Darth Vader: Putting a <u>hex</u> on your family.
