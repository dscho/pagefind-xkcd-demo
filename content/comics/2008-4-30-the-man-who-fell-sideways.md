[Cueball standing, with a dotted line perpendicular to him and a 30 degree angle going downwards.]

From a young age, gravity pulled him wrong.

[Cueball bouncing around his house.]

Sometimes east, sometimes west. When he was restrained, it grew erratic.

*WHAM WHAM*

[Cueball bouncing/rolling on the ground.]

So he fell.

Cueball: AAAA

*THUMPA THUMPA*

[Cueball bouncing/rolling on the ground in a desert.]

Constantly

Cueball: AAAAAAAAA

[Cueball bouncing/rolling off a rock on the ground in a desert.]

Over land...

Cueball: AAAAA-*THUD*-A

[Cueball bouncing/rolling on the ground in the desert.]

Cueball: AAAAAAAAA

[Cueball bouncing/rolling on the ground in the desert.]

Cueball: A-*THUD*-AAAAAA

[Cueball bouncing/rolling on the ground in the desert.]

Cueball: AA-*THUD*-AAAAA

[Cueball skating the surface of the sea.]

And sea.

Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAA

[Cueball skating the surface of the sea.]

Cueball: AAAAAAAA

[Cueball skating the surface of the sea.]

Cueball: AAAAAA

[Cueball skating the surface of the sea.]

Cueball: AAAAAAAA

[Tree in the savanna, with Cueball off the panel.]

He found, where he could, food-

Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAA

[Tree in the savanna, with Cueball still off the panel, but zoomed out so that part of Cueball's bounce/roll path is visible.]

Cueball: AAAAAAAAA

[Cueball upside-down, still bouncing/rolling in the savannah, with a gazelle galloping away from him.]

*GALLOP GALLOP*

Cueball: AAAAAAAAA

[Savanna with a tree in it.]

Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAA

[Megan standing, with Cueball off screen.]

And love.

Cueball: AAAA-*THUD*-AAAA

Cueball: *THUD* ACK *CRASH*

[Cueball crashing into Megan]

Cueball: Hiwhat'syourname-

*WHAM*

[Megan on the ground, with Cueball off screen.]

Cueball: AAAAAAA-*THUD*-AAA

[Megan speaking to Hairy.]

Megan: I met this guy. He knocked me over and tumbled into the distance.

[Megan speaking to the same man from the previous panel, with Hairy's hand to his mouth.]

Megan: We only shared a few seconds, but in his panicked scream I heard something beautiful.

[Megan speaking to the same man from the previous panel.]

Megan: I think... I think I'm...

[Megan speaking to the same man from the previous panel.]

Hairy: Falling for him?

Megan: I wasn't going to say it.

[Megan at hospital with doctor, giving birth.]

She never saw him again. But nine months later...

Doctor: Okay, push!

[Megan at hospital with doctor and new baby, who is bouncing/rolling away.]

Doctor: It's a gir—

Megan: !!

Doctor: Whoops!

Baby: Ga! Ga!

[Baby bouncing/rolling out of hospital.]

Baby: WHEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[Baby bouncing/rolling in front of a sunset.]

Baby: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
