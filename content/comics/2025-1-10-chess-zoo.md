Chess Zoo

Designed to give different types of pieces their own enclosures while letting them interact as much as possible without allowing captures

[A large picture with alternating black and white squares. Some squares have smaller black squares imposed on them. Other squares may have chess pieces or characters on them.]

[Banner above black squares on the top right:]

Banner: *Shh! Pawns promoting.*

[Jill near the center, standing in front of Blondie and pointing forward:]

Jill: Look, mommy! Bishops!
