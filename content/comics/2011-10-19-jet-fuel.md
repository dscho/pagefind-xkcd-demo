[Hairy throws his arms out as he talks to Cueball, who answers while lifting a hand palm up.]

Hairy: 9/11 was an inside job! Jet fuel can't burn hot enough to melt steel!

Cueball: Well, remember — jet fuel wasn't the only thing on those planes. They would've also carried tanks full of the mind-control agents airliners use to make chemtrails.

Cueball: Who *knows* what temperature that stuff burns at!

Hairy: Whoa.

Hairy: Good point!
