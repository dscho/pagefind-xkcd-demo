[Hairy standing in front of Ponytail and Cueball, who are sitting behind a desk]

Hairy: Does anyone have any other concerns?

Cueball: I'm concerned that Minnesota is getting shorter.

[A map of Minnesota beside Cueball, with arrows pointing from the northern and southern borders toward the middle]

Cueball: Because of post-glacial crust rebound, the northern border is moving toward the southern border. It's less than an inch a decade, but I still don't like it.

Cueball: Minnesota shouldn't be squishy.

[Hairy again standing in front of Ponytail and Cueball at the desk. Ponytail is looking at Cueball, whose finger is now raised in the air, gesturing]

Hairy: Okay. Does anyone have any concerns related to the topic of this meeting?

Cueball: All meetings should be about Minnesota until we resolve this.
