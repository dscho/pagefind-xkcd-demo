[Four people are lined up by a covered well, Ponytail in front followed by Cueball, Megan and a man with some kind of hat (could be Beret Guy, but only half of his head is shown so it is not clear). A large sign stands well in front of the well. Ponytail throws in a coin.]

Well: Science may discover immortality, but it won't happen in the next eighty years.

Sign: The Uncomfortable Truths Well.

[Zoom in on the well and Cueball who throws in a coin.]

Well: You'll never find a programming language that frees you from the burden of clarifying your ideas.

Cueball: But *I* know what I mean!

[Same zoom in on Megan who throws in a coin.]

Well: You avoid your friend Mike because you're uncomfortably attracted to him.

[Megan bend in over the well looking down]

Megan: Nice try, Mike.

Megan: Get out of the well.

Mike (from inside the well): Aww.
