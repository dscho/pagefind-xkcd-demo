[White Hat, Megan and Cueball are standing next to each other. White Hat is separated from the other two figures by a small margin.]

White Hat: And another thing that annoys me about people is...

Cueball: *This user has notifications turned off.*

[The camera zooms in on Megan and Cueball. Megan turns to look at Cueball.]

Cueball: *They will see your messages when they're back.*

Cueball: ***Notify anyway?***

[The camera zooms outward to show White Hat. Megan turns back to look at White Hat. All three figures are standing silently.]

[Megan turns to look at Cueball again.]

Megan: What are you--

Cueball: *Shh- It's working.*
