[Megan, Ponytail and Hairy are playing beach volleyball. Megan has her arms outreached, like she had just set the ball. The volleyball, with black and white quadrants, is shown three times: once above the net, once heading towards Ponytail, and once after bouncing off Ponytailâ€™s head. Hairy is running towards Ponytail and the volleyball with his arm raised. Wavy lines are shown on the ground to show sand. A dashed line indicates the path of the volleyball that rotates while in the air.]

Ponytail: Ooh, a strike-slip fault!

*Bonk!*

Ponytail: ***Ow!***
