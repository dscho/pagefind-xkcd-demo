[Star map of the Orion constellation at present. The stars are connected with the constellation lines. In a frame above the stars there is a label:]

Orion Today:

[In the next panel the same stars are drawn but without the constellation lines. Three of the dots that marks the stars are drawn in red and from them a short red line is going to another gray dot that marks a star. A fourth star has a red cross over it. There are two labels in red. From the upper label goes two long red arrows in opposite directions towards the red stars (two of those are close together beneath the label, one is above). And a small red arrow goes from the other label to the crossed out star. The rest of the stars remain unchanged. In a frame above the stars there is a label:]

Predicted Changes:

Upper label: Star movement

Lower label: Star Death (Betelgeuse)

[Star map of the future Orion constellation with one star missing and three having moved noticeably. Different constellation lines are drawn overlaying the new position of stars. A red label is written with a red arrow pointing to the constellation line at the top right. In a frame above the stars there is a label:]

Orion in the future:

Label: Suggested lines

[In the last panel the same stars with constellation lines are drawn. But the Dinosaur Comics T-rex has been drawn in, in full color, matching the constellation lines. Only Orion's Sword is hanging beneath the dinosaur without any connection to the drawing.]
