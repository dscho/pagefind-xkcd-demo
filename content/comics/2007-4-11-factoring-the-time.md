[One man is sitting at a computer. Cueball sits at a separate desk. There is a clock that reads 2:53.]

Cueball: 253 is 11x23

Man at computer: What?

Cueball: I'm factoring the time.

[Zoomed in on Cueball, who explains himself.]

Cueball: I have nothing to do, so I'm trying to calculate the prime factors of the time each minute before it changes.

Cueball: It was easy when I started at 1:00, but with each hour the number gets bigger

Cueball: I wonder how long I can keep up.

[Zoomed back out on the man and Cueball. The man at the desk reaches back and presses a button on the clock.]

*BEEP*

[Clock now reads 14:53.]

Cueball: Hey!

Man at computer: Think fast.
