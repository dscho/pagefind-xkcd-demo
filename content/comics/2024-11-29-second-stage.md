  Hmm, they won't do in-flight delivery, so let's order a new first and second stage to our emergency landing site and then try to touch down on top of them to save time.

[A multi-stage rocket, with a capsule on top, is lifting-off the ground from a launchpad, at least two rocket nozzles are visibly producing a flame, and the pad is surrounded with smoke and/or steam from the blast suppression system. A voice comes from the capsule at the top.]

We have liftoff.

[The first stage separates from the rest of the rocket, part way through the roll-program. There are no obvious engines standing out from the 'second stage' (or extended payload trunk) lower shroud.]

Main engine cutoff.

Stage separation confirmed.

We are go for second stage burn.

Second stage?

Yes.

...What?

[The first stage and the rest of the rocket are drifting apart in apparent freefall. No rocket is firing and the background does not seem to indicate that this view is beyond the atmosphere.<!-- nor that it is, with any passage-through-air lines, but conspicuously not darkened background of even suborbital space -->]

We were supposed to have a second stage?

...Yes!

Did ***you*** set up a second stage?

I thought ***you*** were handling staging!

Oh no.

[They continue to drift apart slowly.]

Okay, don't panic.

Lemme see if we can order a stage online for same-day delivery.

*Sigh*.

Hey, what zip code should I put? Ours keeps changing.
