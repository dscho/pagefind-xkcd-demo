[Cueball, Megan, Ponytail, White Hat, and Knit Cap are sitting around a table on office chairs. The first and last at either end and the other on the same side facing outwards. Everyone is looking at Cueball who is holding a finger up in front of him while speaking. Ponytail is facepalming while replying. The table is covered in sheets of paper and assorted dice.]

Cueball: I grab 2 of the 10 arrows without looking and fire them, hoping I didn't grab one of the 5 cursed ones. Did I?

Ponytail: Sigh. Umm. Okay.

Ponytail: Roll... Uh... Hang on...

Ponytail: Roll 3d6 and a d4. You need... 16 or better to avoid the cursed arrows.
