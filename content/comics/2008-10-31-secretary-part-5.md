[The Senate. Black Hat sits before the committee at his hearing to become Internet Secretary. The 4 senators from Part 3 are in front of him. To the left of the 4 senators are 4 rows of seats, with 3, 2, 1, and 1 Cueball(s) sitting at them. To the left of the second row are two more columns of two, with a Megan and Cueball at the first row of the first column and a Cueball with his face down, presumably resting at the first row of the second column. Behind Black Hat are 4 Cueballs sitting in chairs in front of 3 tables, with 2 Cueballs sitting next to each other in between the 2 other Cueballs. There are 2 more Cueballs sitting at different tables behind the 2nd and 3rd tables, and a final Cueball in the 2nd column that is slightly cut-off by the frame.]

Chairman: We were convened here to review your nomination for the position of internet secretary.

Chairman: However, on review of your qualifications, we've decided to sentence you to death.

Chairman: An unorthodox move, sure. But the vote was unanimous.

[Black Hat is leaning back in his chair.]

[Tron Paul's lightcycle swerves wildly.]

Meanwhile...

Tron Paul: There's no grid! How do I steeeeer!!!!!

[Back at the Senate. Black Hat is standing.]

Black Hat: Well, it's been fun. But I was never actually interested in taking the position. Good lord; listening to internet arguments all day? No thank you.

Chairman: Then why did you sit through all those hearings?

Black Hat: It was taking us a while to move the pumps into the maintenance tunnels.

[The committee members murmur among themselves.]

[There is a panel in the floor between Black Hat and the committee.]

*RUMBLE*

*plink plink*

[A red playpen ball bursts out of the panel and rolls towards the committee chairman.]

*plink*

[The room is still. Black Hat's arms are folded.]

[A geyser of red, white, and blue playpen balls bursts through the panel in the floor. Black Hat is already gone.]

*FOOM*

[The committee members chase Black Hat out the door as the Senate floor floods with playpen balls.]

[The chase continues into the rotunda, as does the flood of playpen balls.]

[Black Hat stands in the middle of the rotunda as it fills with playpen balls, surrounded by members of the committee.]

Committee Members: Security! Someone!

Committee Members: Get Him!

[Tron Paul bursts through the wall.]

*CRASH*

Tron Paul: Aaaaa!

[Black Hat grabs the bottom of the lightcycle as Tron Paul goes by.]

*snag*

Tron Paul: Hey!

[Black Hat swings onto the top of the light cycle.]

[Black Hat crouches on top of the light cycle.]

Tron Paul: Get Off!

[Tron Paul and Black Hat crash through the far wall of the rotunda.]

*CRASH*

[Tron Paul hits the ground.]

*WHAM*

Tron Paul: Ow!

[Black Hat runs away.]

Tron Paul: Ughhh.

[The lightcycle disappears.]

Tron Paul: I feel queasy...

Cory Doctorow, above: Hey!

Black Hat: Hi, Cory.

Cory Doctorow: Need a lift?

Black Hat: Sure.

[Black Hat and Cory Doctorow depart in Doctorow's balloon.]

Cory Doctorow: So are you, like, a fugitive now?

Black Hat: Well, I never did give them my name...

[Senators play in the playpen balls.]

But in the rotunda

Senators: Let's jump down here from the balcony!

Senators: Senior senators first!

Senators: Wheeee!

Senators: I'm a submarine!

All is forgiven.
