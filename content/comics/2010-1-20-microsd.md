  That card holds a refrigerator carton's worth of floppy discs, and a soda can full of those cards could hold the entire iTunes store's music library. Mmmm.

[Cueball and a friend approach a table.]

Cueball: Hey, what's up?

Friend (as a second Cueball): Shhhhh.

Cueball: Hrm?

Friend: There's a microSD card on your table.

[A 16GB microSD card sits next to an assortment of coins for size reference.]

Cueball (out of panel): So?

Friend (out of panel): I dunno, high storage densities freak me out. A whole aisle of library shelves on something smaller than a dime.

[The two people stand near the table, the friend peering at the coins and card on the table.]

Friend: Libraries are unnerving enough-millions of ideas surrounding you, towering over you. These cards fill me with that same reverence, that same intimidation.

[Cueball stands alone.]

Friend (out of panel): ...that same faint arousal. Maybe I'll just touch it.

Cueball: If you lose that card I'm <u>NOT</u> helping you find it.
