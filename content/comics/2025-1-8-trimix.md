  You don't want the nitrogen percentage to be too high or you run the risk of eutrophication.

[In a single frame five images of Cueball are shown as a kind of a cartoon event sequence, from left to right, with each image a later time in the process. The first image shows Cueball standing by the shore of a body of water. He is wearing scuba gear, goggles, a regulator, a scuba tank with a small H logo on it on his back, and fins, which almost touch the water.]

[In the next four images he has the same equipment on, but with changes. He is presumably still at the edge of the water, but the water is not drawn in the next four images.]

[In the second image, Cueball's scuba tank is beginning to float upwards, so the end that is not tethered to Cueball moves out and up, as shown with three small lines beneath the tank.]

[In the third image the scuba tank is now floating above Cueball's head and the strings pull his arms a bit upwards. Cueball has turned his head looking up at the tank floating above and behind his head. Again three small lines beneath the tank indicates it is moving upwards.]

[In the fourth image Cueball is now being lifted up, so his feet are now off the ground and he is tilting forward. The tank is now pointing its bottom almost straight up and Cueball is looking down with his arms out to each side as the tank pulls him up. Two lines on either side of the tank indicate that it now wobbles above him as it lifts him up.]

[In the fifth and last image the scuba tank is now pulling a dangling Cueball with his legs splayed high above the ground, above his head's height in the first image. The tank is now turned so it points its bottom to the left with lines on either side indicating wobbling motion. Cueball is floating in a roughly horizontal position as the tank's straps pull him upwards. At this point he yells:]

Cueball: *Help!*

Trimix scuba divers need to be careful not to let the helium percentage get too high.
