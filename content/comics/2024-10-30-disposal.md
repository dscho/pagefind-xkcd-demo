  We were disappointed that the rocket didn't make a THOOOONK noise when it went into the tube, but we're setting up big loudspeakers for future launches to add the sound effect.

[A two-stage rocket is ascending with a plume of exhaust behind it]

[The first stage falls off and the second stage ignites]

[The first stage begins to fall, turned off]

[The first stage reignites to control trajectory and attitude]

[The first stage falls toward a large, but barely wider hole with a lid. A Cueball is holding the lid open, which has a hinge attaching it to the ground]

[Cueball pushes the lid closed]

[The first stage, now out of sight, explodes, with Cueball shielding his ear with one hand and flinching away from the loud noise]

BOOOOM

[Caption below the panels:]

Our rockets were good at steering, but we couldn't get them to land without exploding, so we just dug a rocket disposal hole.
