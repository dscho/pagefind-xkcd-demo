[At the top there is a four panel regular comic strip.]

[Cueball and Ponytail are talking; Ponytail is sitting on the back of a chair with her feet on the seat, and Cueball is sitting on the floor facing her.]

Ponytail: So how far did you get with her?

Cueball: Second base?

[Zoom in on Ponytail on the chair.]

Ponytail: Wait, which one is that? Below the waist, but... not under the clothes?

Cueball (off-panel): I think that's... shortstop?

[In a frameless panel, Cueball now almost lies down and Ponytail is sitting on the armrest of the chair.]

Ponytail: You should try crossing the pitcher's mound. Then down the 50-yard line, and right past her ten-pin.

Cueball: Sounds tricky.

[Again a zoom in on Ponytail now on the armrest.]

Ponytail: Yeah. Last time I tried it, I got a red flag. If you know what I mean.

Cueball (off-panel): I really don't.

[Below the strip there is a large frame with a diagram of a baseball diamond.]

[At the bottom left there is a box with this text:]
