[A Map of lakes and oceans showing the depths of various lakes and ocean attributes.]

Lakes and Oceans Depths and animal/ship/boat lengths are to scale; horizontal distance is not.

Fun Fact: The *Edmund Fitzgerald*, The Kursk, and The Lusitania all sank in water shallower than they were long.

[Vertical axis of depths, ranging from 1,000 m to 12,000 m.]
