[On a grey board, there are 23 Advent calendars behind large "windows", numbered from 3 to 25, plus two open calendars with their covers torn off.]

[From top-left to bottom-right, the boxes are numbered as such: (opened), 14, 23, 16, 11, 3; 5, 24, 18, 7, 21; 10, 17, 4, 9, 22, 15, 12; 8, 20, 13, 25, (opened), 19, 6]

[Each calendar numbered *n* has 26âˆ’*n* squares in it.]

[The open calendar on the top left has 25 squares, two of which are black. The other open calendar has 24 squares, one of which is black.]
