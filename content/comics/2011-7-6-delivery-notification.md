[The first panel is a UPS InfoNotice®. Most of the text on it is just scribbles, though the company logo and header is clear.]

[Cueball opens their door to see the InfoNotice® stuck on his door.]

Cueball: *What!* I've been here all day!

Cueball 2 (off-screen): Huh?

Cueball: They have my laptop.

[Cueball and Cueball 2 are standing next to each other. Cueball has his arms to his sides, in annoyance.]

Cueball 2: So get it tomorrow.

Cueball: I fly out in the morning and they don't open till noon!

Cueball 2: Sucks.

[Cueball stands, working on a laptop.]

Cueball: It's *right there*. I can see the UPS building on the map.

Cueball 2 (off-screen): Ok...

[Dramatic zoom to the Cueball's upper torso and face, along with clenched fist.]

Cueball: My laptop is there.

Cueball: It's *mine*.

Cueball: I'm going to get it.

[Even more dramatic zoom! Cueball's face fills the panel.]

Cueball 2 (off-screen): They won't let you.

Cueball: Who are they to keep from me what is mine?

Cueball 2 (off-screen): Dude, they—

[Zoomed out on Cueball, who spins around, raising a finger.]

Cueball: A quest is at hand!

Cueball 2(off-screen): Security's gonna throw you out.

Cueball: I fear neither death nor pain. But I will not go unarmed.

[Three inset panels overlap, in a montage format.]

[Elves in long robes stand around a table, on which lies a broken sword.]

 Light the beacons and send word to the Elves.

 They must reforge the sword of my fathers.

[An Elf beats the sword together on an anvil.]

[An Elf rides a horse, silhouetted by the full moon.]

 Ere dawn, I will go forth to the Sorting Depot.

[The Elf knocks at the door, sword in scabbard held under arm.]

*Knock knock knock knock*

[Cueball opens the door, to find a second InfoNotice® stuck on top of the first. The Elf is gone.]
