  What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged? Are you sure you're not... ::puts on sunglasses:: ...projecting?

What your favorite

**Map Projection**

says about you

[All of these are organized as Title, a copy of the particular projection underneath, and what it says about you under that.]

\*Mercator

\*\*You're not really into maps.

\*Van der Grinten

\*\*You're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just wish it weren't square. The Earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like circles. Today is gonna be a good day!

\*Robinson

\*\*You have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy The Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.

\*Dymaxion

\*\*You like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the Segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.

\*Winkel-Tripel

\*\*National Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since *long* before "Nat Geo" showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favorite musical genre is "Post–".

\*Goode Homolosine

\*\*They say mapping the Earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems enough to you. You like easy solutions.You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect *normal* people to Congress instead of Politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the restaurants near the gates and serve *that* on board. You change your car's oil, but secretly wonder if you really *need* to.

\*Hobo-Dyer

\*\*You want to avoid cultural imperialism, but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic. You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.

\*Plate Carrée <small>(Equirectangular)</small>

\*\*You think this one is fine. You like how X and Y map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.

\*A Globe!

\*\*Yes, you're very clever.

\*Waterman Butterfly

\*\*Really? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill Map it's based— ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these questions. Are you doing anything tonight?

\*Peirce Quincuncial

\*\*You think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After you first saw *Inception*, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It freaks you out to realize that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them. You *have* really looked at your hands.

\*Gall-Peters

\*\*I *hate* you.
