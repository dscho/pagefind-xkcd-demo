[Cueball sits writing in a diary on a desert island, only the sandy tip of which with a palm tree on it stands above the water. Beneath the surface is a kelp forest consisting of seven kelp, one large white shark, what is possibly a smaller shark, a stingray, a shipwreck, a large pink fish surrounded by seventeen dots, a submarine, seven green fish at the tip of the submarine, three large jellyfish, a giant squid fighting a sperm whale, a crashed plane, four coral formations, a thermal vent emitting a plume of smoke surrounded by four annelids, three clams, and a snail.]

Cueball: Day 44: Still stranded, with nothing but flat empty water as far as the eye can see.
