[A person with long curly hair is standing to the right of a hanging crocked on the wall behind him. A person speaks from off-panel (a judge of some sort, according to the official transcript). Given the title text there is reason to believe the long haired "woman" is indeed a man nicknamed Little Bobby Tables.]

Sign: Auditions

Judge: *Seriously?*

Judge: Sorry, no, that's a huge mood killer.

Judge: <big>*Next!*</big>

[Caption below the panel:]

Before I have a kid, I'm moving to Rogers Street in Cambridge, MA, and then getting a cat named "Mister"

Just to guarantee the kid will never go into porn.
