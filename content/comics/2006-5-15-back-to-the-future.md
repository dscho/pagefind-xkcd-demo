[Megan and Hairy are standing, talking to one another.]

Hairy: This weekend, my professor friend built a time machine out of a DeLorean and I went back in time! I helped make sure my parents got together and helped my dad to be less of a loser.

Megan: Wow! Do you still have the time machine?

Hairy: Nah. But I did what I really needed to do.

Megan: I...nothing.
