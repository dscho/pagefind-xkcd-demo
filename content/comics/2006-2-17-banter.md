  This was an actual mock conversation between me and a friend at TGIF. The waitress walked up around panel 5 and was somewhat put off.

[Two Cueball like characters have a discussion. They are drawn the same in all eight panels.]

Guy: Man, she's hot

Friend: Whatever, you are so gay.

Guy: C'mon, everyone knows you're the gay one.

Friend: Hey, your mom's pretty masculine, but sleeping with her doesn't make me gay.

Guy: Fag.

Friend: Ass pirate.

Guy: Fudge packer

Friend: Cock jockey

Guy: Cum dumpster.

[Beat panel.]

Guy: Okay, seriously, are you gay? Because if you've been holding out on me, we're missing out.

Friend: No, it's cool.

Guy: OK, me neither.
