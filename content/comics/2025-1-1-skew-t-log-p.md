  The most important quantity for meteorologists is of course the product of latent pressure and temperostrophic enthalpy, though 'how nice the weather is' is a close second.

How to interpret a skew-T log-P diagram

[The comic shows a skew-T log-P diagram. On it are various labels, including isobars, comments, and other interpretations of the diagram.]

[Left to the diagram is an upwards-pointing arrow with the label "Pressure Latitude". Right to the diagram is a downwards-pointing arrow with the label "Entropic Density". Below the diagram is a right-pointing arrow with the label "Enthalpic Pressure".]

[Two solid and dashed lines extend from the top line to the bottom line of the diagram.]

[The remaining various labels are inside the diagram.]

[Labels on the left:]

[An arrow pointing to a densive dashed segment attaching to one solid line:] Latent heat of cooling

[A label lying on one horizontal guide:] — Isobars —

[An arrow pointing to the intersection of one solid and dashed line:] Omnitrophic wind

[A label lying on one left-downward guide:] Isomers

[A label lying on one right-downward guide:] Line of constant thermodynamics

[An arrow pointing to a solid dashed segment on one left-downward guide:] Uncomfortably moist adiabat

[An arrow pointing to the same solid line as ‘latent heat of cooling’:] Humidor

[An arrow pointing to a steep peak on the same solid line:] Oops, the balloon flew through a ghost

[To adjacent arrows pointing to two left-downward guide not perfectly coinciding to each other:] These lines are slightly different because Dave messed them up

[An arrow pointing to the end of solid and dashed lines on the bottom line:] Don’t stand here or you might get hit by a balloon

[Labels on the right:]

[An arrow pointing to the top line:] No birds up here :(

[An arrow pointing to one solid line generally:] Track of rising weather balloon

[An arrow pointing to one dashed line generally:] Track of popped balloon falling back down

[An arrow pointing to crossing of two solid lines, The area enclosed by which is painted black] Meteogenesis

[An arrow pointing to a knot on one solid line:] Seems bad

[An arrow pointing to a dot] Dew point

[An arrow pointing to a highlighted left-downward guide:] Heavyside layer

[Text written sideways below the line:] These lines are tilted because the wind is blowing them
