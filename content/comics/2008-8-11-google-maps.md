My road trip with my brother ran into trouble around page three of the Google Maps printout

[Google Maps printout.]

← 70. Slight **left** at **RT-22** - go 6.8 mi

→ 71. Turn **right** to stay on **RT-22** - go 2.6 mi

← 72. Turn **left** at **Lake Shore Rd** - go 312 ft

→ 73. Turn **right** at **Dock St** - go 427 ft

[An icon of water] 74. Take the **ferry** across the **lake.** - go 2.8 mi

[A car is driving in the dark.]

Brother: Okay, now take Dock St toward the ferry.

Cueball: We're supposed to take a ferry? It's past midnight, and these woods are creepy.

Brother: Google Maps wouldn't steer us wrong.

[Cueball and his brother stand outside the car. The ferry has a sign on it reading CLOSED.]

[Cueball is standing next to his brother, who is holding a Google Maps printout.]

[Cueball motions towards his brother.]

Cueball: Let me see those directions.

[Google Maps printout.]

[An icon of water] 74. Take the **ferry** across the **lake.** - go 2.8 mi

↗ 75. Climb the **HILL** toward **Hangman's Ridge,** avoiding any **mountain lions.** - up 1,172 ft

[An icon of a van] 77. Tell **Charlie** the **Dancing Stones** are **restless**. He will give you his **van**. - Careful

[An icon of a straw man] 78. Take **Charlie's van** down **Old Mine Road**. Do not wake the **Straw Man**. - go π mi

← 79. Turn left on **Comstock**. When you feel the **blood** chill in your **veins**, stop the van and **get out.** - go 3.2 mi

[An icon of a menacing face] 81. The **Spectral Wolf** fears only **fire**. The **Google Maps Team** can no longer help you, but if you master the **wolf**, he will guide you. **Godspeed.** - go ?? mi
