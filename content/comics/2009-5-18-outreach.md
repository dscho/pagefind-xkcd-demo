  Completely implausible? Yes. Nevertheless, worth keeping a can of shark repellent next to the bed.

[Ponytail faces two Cueball-like guys. All three are wearing goggles and lab-coats. Between them on a shelf stands a microscope and a beaker.]

Ponytail: The tracking tag will record the shark's movement and habits.

[The capsule is shown to float upward towards a water surface.]

Ponytail (narrating): Then, it will pop free and float to the surface.

[A coast is shown, with arrows directed from water to land. A small white circle on one of the arrows indicate the balloon.]

Ponytail (narrating): We can't afford a recovery program, so the capsules will inflate helium balloons, drift over land,

[The capsule is shown in close up. It has a caption on it.]

Ponytail (narrating):  And hopefully be found and mailed to us. Any questions?

Caption: If found please call

[Ponytail is standing over a groggy shark on a boat, with water behind her and a coastline in the background. She attaches the tracking tag to the shark.]

*Chunk*

[The shark is dropped headfirst off the boat, into the water with a large splash.]

*Sploosh*

Shark: !!!

[The course of the shark is shown, weaving around islands.]

[The capsule is shown sticking out of the shark at the moment it is ready to pop free.]

*Click*

[The capsule remains attached to the shark.]

[The balloon starts to inflate, still attached to the shark and underwater.]

*Hissss*

[As the balloon inflates, it starts to pull the shark to the surface.]

Shark: ??

[The balloon breaks the surface, pulling the shark with it.]

[Jill, eating an ice cream cone is standing together with Cueball to the right in an otherwise empty frame.]

[Two screaming scientists (A Cueball-like guy and Ponytail) runs past the two, who turns to look after them. The guy is holding the microscope and Ponytail the beaker from the first frame.]

Scientists: Aaaaaaaa

[A shark attached to a huge balloon floats past the girl and Cueball, it follows the scientists while snapping its jaws.]

Shark: *Chomp chomp*

[After the shark is gone, Jill turns to Cueball.]

Jill: Daddy?

Cueball: Yes?

Jill: I want to be a scientist.
