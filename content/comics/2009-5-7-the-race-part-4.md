[Cueball and Nathan Fillion are ready on the start line on their electric skateboards.]

Voice off panel: On your mark...

Voice: Get set...

Nathan: Remember episode 11, when I got all naked in that desert?

Voice: Go!

[Nathan speeds away leaving Cueball standing at the start line.]

Voice: ...I said "Go."

Voice: Someone throw some water on him.

Cueball: Can't...get it...out of my head...

[Nathan on walkie talkie, speeding on his skateboard.]

Nathan: He's right behind me. Kaylee, I'm gonna try a Crazy Ivan.

Jewel [on walkie talkie] ([[579]] shows Nathan's naming confusion): That doesn't make any sense, Nathan.

Nathan: Trust me.

Jewel: No, I mean it's not a skateboard maneuver. The concept doesn't even apply to this situation.

Nathan [via walkie talkie]: That's why it *just might work!*

Jewel: No, that's the *opposite* of true!

Nathan: On my mark, override the remote differential and throw her into a spin.

Jewel [via walkie talkie]: okay, but—

Nathan: Mark!

*WHAM*

[Nathan lying injured on the ground next to his skateboard, Cueball cruises past.]

*Whirrrrrrrr*

[Nathan, trying to stand up.]

Nathan: I'm down. Tell Summer "The chickens are in the hayloft. Plan Gamma is a go."

[Nathan, one foot on skateboard, looking at walkie talkie.]

*mumbling from walkie talkie*

Jewel: She says, "Plan gamma acknowledged. The meerkats are in the bag.

[Summer Glau is walking off panel.]

Jewel [to walkee talkie]: So we're good?

Nathan: Hard to tell with her. Do you see an actual bag of meerkats?

Jewel: No.

Nathan: Then we're probably good.

[Cueball screeching to a halt as he sees Summer Glau.]

Cueball: Oh! Hi, Miss Glau! I'd love to talk, but Nathan's back on his feet and catching up.

[Summer grabs Cueball's arm.]

*Grab*

Cueball: Wha—

[Summer kicks Cueball in the face whilst pulling his arm towards her, he flies off his skateboard.]

[Summer walking away as Cueball lies crippled on the floor with his sunglasses beside him.]

[Cueball still lying on the floor.]

Cueball [thinking]: I've never been so turned on in my life.
