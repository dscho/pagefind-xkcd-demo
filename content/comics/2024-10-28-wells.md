[Megan is standing on the left and facing Cueball on the right. Megan has her left palm raised.]

Megan: I need water, so I think I'll dig a deep hole and drink whatever liquid I find at the bottom.

Cueball: What will you do after you drink it all? Dig another hole?

Megan: I dunno. Hopefully it magically refills itself or something.
