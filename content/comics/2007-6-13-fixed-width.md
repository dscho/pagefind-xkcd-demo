[A man, Rob, is sitting at a computer. The text is an IRC-style transcript of a conversation, in a fixed-width font. He is text-messaging a girl he slept with named Emily; their messages read as follows:]

<pre>

<rob> hi

<emily> hey you

<rob> last night was nice

<emily> the best i've had

<rob> yeah it was AMAZING

<emily> ok, i have to ask

<emily> is this for real?

<emily> or is it just sex

<rob> definitely just sex

<emily> holy shit

<emily> are you serious?

<emily> you don't know how much that made

        my stomach hurt

<emily> i want to cry

<rob> i'm sorry

<rob> i wanted to type 'i love you'

<rob> but our line lengths were syncing up

<emily> ...

<rob> and it would have broken the pattern

\* emily has disconnected
