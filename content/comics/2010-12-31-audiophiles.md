  For years, I took the wrong lesson from that Monster Cable experiment and only listened to my music through alligator-clipped coat hangers.

[Cueball and Megan are talking over the telephone. The first two panels are split diagonally. Cueball is at a store, holding a box, and Megan is consulting with him.]

Cueball: Do we have an RCA-to-3.5mm female-female plug? I'm getting some speakers for the new Xbox, since the monitor doesn't have any.

Megan: Are they crappy laptop speakers? *Ugh.*

[Cueball is standing next to a sale rack.]

Cueball: Does it matter? I just want to hear if I'm getting shot at, not savor every detail of a beautiful musical soundscape.

Megan: You've never *heard* a beautiful musical soundscape. You listen to 96kbps flv rips from YouTube.

[Megan is walking.]

Cueball: Whatever. I'm just going to get these $20 speakers. Five watts will be plenty.

Megan: Five watts for a living room sound system? Is that a joke?

[Zoomed in panel on Cueball]:

Cueball: No, this is a joke: How many audiophiles does it take to change a lightbulb?

Megan: How many?

Cueball: I'll tell you later—you wouldn't appreciate the punchline over this 12kbps cell phone codec.
