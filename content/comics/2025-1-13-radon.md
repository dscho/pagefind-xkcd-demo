[Cueball is on the left, and is approached by Ponytail, who is reading a Geiger counter in her hand and is holding a toolbox in her other hand.]

Ponytail: Radon levels in your basement are pretty high.

Ponytail: When was the planet under this home built?

[Ponytail stops walking and lowers the Geiger counter]

Cueball: Uhh, about 4½ billion years ago, I think?

Ponytail: Oof. I was afraid of that.

[A frameless panel]

Ponytail: This planet was contaminated with uranium when it formed. You really should have let it fully decay before building.

Ponytail: Wait another 100 billion years and these rocks will be fine.

[Zoom in on Cueball's head]

Cueball: But the Sun will burn out in 5 billion years.

Ponytail (off-panel): Yikes, you built around a short-lived yellow star? What a mess.

Ponytail (off-panel): Hope you have good insurance.
