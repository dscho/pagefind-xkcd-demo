[Cueball is standing in front of a whiteboard, which contains a diagram depicting a muon passing through the atmosphere, a distance labeled with a cursive letter, the equation for the Lorentz factor, and some illegible text. He's facing away from the whiteboard and holding a pointer that points towards the diagram.]

Cueball: *Muons* created in the upper atmosphere decay immediately, but fast moving *muuuuuoooons* are able to reach the surface due to their longer half-lives.

Physics tip: Remember to adjust your pronunciations to account for time dilation.
