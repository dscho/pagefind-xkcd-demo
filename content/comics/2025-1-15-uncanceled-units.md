[White Hat and Cueball are standing to either side of a refrigerator. The fridge has two top compartments and one bottom compartment. The top left compartment has a tall handle on its right, the top right compartment has a tall handle on its left, and the bottom compartment has a long handle on its top. The top left compartment has a paper attached to it with unreadable text, possibly an advertisement.]

White Hat: This fridge uses only 3 kWh per day!

Cueball: But will it fit in my kitchen? The ceiling there is only 50 gallons per square foot.
