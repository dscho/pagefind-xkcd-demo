[Cueball and Megan are clinking wine glasses while Ponytail is digging with a shovel under a sign standing on two legs next to Ponytail. From the off-panel to the left several voices are shouting. On the sign are two large words above two lines of unreadable lines of text.]

Off-panel voices: <big>*Happy New Year!*</big>

Sign: <big>Time</big> Capsule

[A dirty box with a hasp closing it. There is a label on the lid:]

Do not open until 2025

[Cueball and Megan, holding their wine glasses, look over Ponytail's shoulder as she crouches down in front of the box and opens it with an audible sound. The shovel is standing behind the box, dug into the ground.]

[The open box is shown revealing that it contains a second, pristine box with a similar label:]

Do not open after 2024
