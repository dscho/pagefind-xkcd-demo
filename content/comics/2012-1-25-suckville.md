[Megan is kneeling on the floor, playing a card game.]

Megan: Hah!

Megan: Welcome to Suckville&ndash;population: *You*.

[In a frame-less panel, Cueball is sitting on the floor opposite her, also playing the game.]

Cueball: Why are you using 2000 census data?

Cueball: That's an old figure.

[Megan turns around from the game to look at her laptop, which is sitting on the floor behind her.]

Megan: I couldn't find Suckville in the 2010 census.

Cueball: Huh? It's right there in SF-1 table P1.

Megan: Oh. So it is.

[Megan turns back to Cueball, who is looking at his cards.]

Megan: Well, then.

Megan: Welcome to Suckville&ndash;population: 83.

Cueball: Much better.
