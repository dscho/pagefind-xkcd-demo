Local Boltzmann Constant

[The two extremes of the dial are labeled as follows, the first value on the left and the second value on the right:]

1.418×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K

1.351×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K

[The indicator line is pointing to a position on the dial somewhere around 1.375×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K (between the 12th and 13th large ticks clockwise out of 19 total).]
