[A large panel the combined width of the four panels below it.]

[A blue Linux terminal installer screen with a grey box that is labeled "[!]CONFIGURE THE NETWORK" in red. Below, in black, it reads "Please enter the hostname for the system." Below is an empty blue entry box with a cursor and dashed underscore, and below this it says "<GO BACK>".]

[Cueball sits at his computer, Megan stands behind him.]

Megan: You've been staring at that screen a while.

Cueball: Picking a good server name is important.

[Megan stares at him.]

[She continues to stare.]

[Cueball pushes his chair back, puts one elbow on the back of the chair and points with his other hand at the screen.]

Megan: And yet you settled on "Caroline" for our daughter in like 15 seconds.

Cueball: But this is a *server!*

Cueball: Besides, I had to—you were trying to name her "Epidural."

Megan: Those *were* good drugs.
