  C'mon, ESA Solar Orbiter team, just give the Parker probe a LITTLE nudge at aphelion. Crash it into the sun. Fulfill the dream of Icarus. It is your destiny.

Sun Avoidance Skill Leaderboard

[A table with an ellipsis indicating a large number of rows being omitted, followed by seven substantive rows. All of the rank numbers except "1." are cut off at the left, with the leftmost digit being a partially cut-off "4", except that on the fourth substantive row, the "4" is shown in full with a cut-off "2" to its left. Hence, these ranks actually represent numbers with at least eight digits.]
