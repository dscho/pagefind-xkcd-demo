[A bride in full wedding dress, that looks like Megan, and Cueball with a bow-tie as the groom stand next to each other. Each has a hand outstretched toward the other.]

Officiator (off panel): Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?

Bride ('Amy'): ...No.

[Cueball steps back in surprise. The bride removes a wig to reveal that she is in fact a Cueball-like man.]

Groom: *What? Amy!?*

Man: I'm not Amy. None of this was real. You're back in senior year. It's the big game.

[Cueball puts his hands to his head in confusion. The man holds up an American football, still holding the wig in his other hand.]

Cueball: What *is* this!?

Man: *The greatest high school football misdirection play of all time.*

[Cueball puts his hands to his mouth as the man in the wedding dress begins to run backwards, away from him holding up the ball.]

[Cueball remains frozen in horror as the man turns and dashes toward the goalpost in the distance.]
