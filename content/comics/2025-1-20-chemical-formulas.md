[Cueball is holding a pointer and gesturing towards a whiteboard that shows the chemical formulas HCOOH and CH‚ÇÉCOOH. Below these, respectively, are classic diagramatic representations of formic/methanoic acid [with an apparently accidental doubled bond between the carbon and the hydroxy group] and acetic/ethanoic acid; being, in turn, a single- and double-carbon chain molecule with a double-bonded oxygen (carbonyl group) plus an oxygen-hydrogen (hydroxy) upon one carbon of each, to form the full carboxyl grouping, and hydrogens completing all other expected bonds.]

Cueball: The two simplest carboxylic acids are hakoo and chuckoo.
