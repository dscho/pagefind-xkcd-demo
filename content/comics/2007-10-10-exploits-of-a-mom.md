[Mrs. Roberts receives a call from her son's school on her wireless phone. She is standing with a cup of hot coffee or tea (shown with a small line above the cup) facing a small round three-legged table to the right. The voice of the caller is indicated to come from the phone with a zigzag line.]

Voice over the phone: Hi, This is your son's school. We're having some computer trouble.

[In this frame-less panel Mrs. Roberts has put the cup down on the table turned facing out.]

Mrs. Roberts: Oh, dear &ndash; did he break something?

Voice over the phone: In a way &ndash;

[Mrs. Roberts is now drinking from the cup again looking right. The table is not shown.]

Voice over the phone: Did you really name your son <code>Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--</code> ?

Mrs. Roberts: Oh, yes. Little Bobby Tables, we call him.

[Mrs. Roberts holds the cup down.]

Voice over the phone: Well, we've lost this year's student records. I hope you're happy.

Mrs. Roberts: And I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs.
