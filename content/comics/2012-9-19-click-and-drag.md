[This transcript only covers the first four panels as they are shown here above (i.e. before you click and drag).]

[Cueball is narrating the story, all the text is written in boxes above and below him without speech lines connecting to him.]

[Cueball is floating by holding onto a balloon with one hand.]

From the stories

I expected the world to be sad

And it was

[Cueball has grabbed hold of the balloon with both hands.]

And I expected it to be wonderful.

[The wind picks up and blows Cueball to the right.]

It was.

[Full width panel where the scene opens up. You see Cueball is about a tree's-height from the ground. To the right there is a tall tree with no leaves on it and a broken limb. Below him are some rocks and grass. This is the initial view of the world, that can be clicked and dragged. It is part of tile named 1 North 1 East.]

I just didn't expect it to be so *big*.

[The rest of the comic is transcribed below in the [[1110: Click and Drag#List of details and references (with transcript)|List of details and references]] section.]
