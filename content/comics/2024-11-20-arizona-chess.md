[White Hat and Cueball are sitting across from each other playing chess. The time, shown above them in white on a black screen, reads 6:35 for White Hat, and 0:28 for Cueball.]

White Hat: It’s late, I’m up a pawn, and you’re out of time. It’s over.

Cueball: Ah, you’re forgetting something.

[Cueball gestures with one hand above the chessboard. His time now reads 0:19.]

Cueball: Did you know this building straddles the Arizona border?

Cueball: It actually runs right through the table. You're on the Arizona side.

[Cueball raises his hand further to gesture at his time. It beeps and is now blank and white.]

Cueball: This tournament started Saturday, November 2nd. Now it's almost 2AM on the 3rd.

Cueball: And there's something you should know about Arizona.

Chess clock: BEEP

[White Hat raises his head slightly to look at the timer. Cueball's time now reads 60:07. Cueball lowers his hand to make a move.]

White Hat: ***What?!*** No! That's not how... ***No!!***

Cueball: Looks like it's daylight ***slaying*** time.
