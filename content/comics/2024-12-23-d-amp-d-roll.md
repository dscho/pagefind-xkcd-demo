  Under some circumstances, if you throw a D8 and then a D12 at an enemy, thanks to the D8's greater pointiness you actually have to roll a D12 and D8 respectively to determine damage.

[Cueball, Megan, Ponytail, White Hat, and Knit Cap are sitting around a table in a tabletop gaming session. Both Cueball and Knit Cap are sitting in spin office chairs, with Cueball leaning forward and Knit Cap leaning back on his arm. White Hat sits to the right of Ponytail and Megan to the left. They are both looking at Ponytail, while Ponytail is looking at Cueball. Objects such as dice, miniatures, a map, and papers are on the table.]

Cueball: I roll D20... 18.

Ponytail: The kobold is unaffected.

Ponytail: Honestly, I don't know why you thought dice would help. You should probably try a sword or something instead.
