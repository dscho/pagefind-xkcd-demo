[Cueball and Hairy stand next to each other talking.]

Hairy: I just feel like somewhere out there is the girl for me.

Cueball: Yeah.

Hairy: Someone loving and caring.

Cueball: I know what you mean.

Hairy: A girl whose only mode of transportation is the M.C. Hammer Slide.

Cueball: Yeah.

Cueball: ...Wait, what?
