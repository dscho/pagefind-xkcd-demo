[Ponytail enters from the right dragging Hairy along by his hand, as she moves towards Cueball who stands with Megan in his hand.]

Ponytail: I thought your android girlfriend was cool so I got myself an android boyfriend.

[Suddenly the Megan android runs into the arms of the Hairy android, while Ponytail has let go of his hand. Ponytails head swirls around to follow her run by.]

Ponytail: He's really great. I like how—

Ponytail: Uh.

[Cueball and Ponytail look towards the two androids, but they are now outside this frame-less panel.]

Off-panel sound: *\*Zip\**

Off-panel voice: *Mmmmm*

[Cueball and Ponytail still look at the scene off panel.]

Cueball: ...Huh.

Ponytail: It's like somebody stuck a vibrator in a fleshlight.

Off-panel sound: *Whirrr*

Off-panel voice: *Mmmm*

Off-panel sound: *Click*
