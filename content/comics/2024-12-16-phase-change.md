  Even when you try to make nice, smooth ice cubes in a freezer, sometimes one of them will shoot out a random ice spike, which physicists ascribe to kiki conservation.

[A vertical graph is shown, indicating temperature in degrees Celsius, with a horizontal dotted line at zero degrees. The graph has a range of 11.5°C to -11.5°C and a tick for each degree on the vertical axis. The area above the dotted line is filled with several illustrations of liquid water in various forms--dripping down, forming a droplet, pouring from a glass, splashing on a surface of water, etc. This area is labeled "Bouba" with an arrow pointing up. The area below the dotted line is filled with illustrations of ice in various forms--icicles, ice cubes, snowflakes, a thin piano-shaped piece of ice, a thicker sheet of ice on water along with an iceberg. This area is labeled "Kiki" with an arrow pointing down.]

[Caption below the panel:]

When water temperature falls below 0°C, it undergoes a phase transition from bouba to kiki.
