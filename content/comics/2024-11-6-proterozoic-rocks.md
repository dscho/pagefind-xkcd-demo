[Cueball is seen at a distance, walking amid a rocky landscape.]

I love being near Proterozoic rocks.

These ones are 1.1 billion years old.

That's so, ***so*** old.

[Cueball standing next to a rock.]

Eyes evolved half a billion years ago. The first time a rock was ever looked at, these rocks were already 500 million years old.

[Cueball sitting atop a large rock.]

People say geologic time makes them feel small. But when I touch this rock, it's like I'm a part of it, spanning a vast abyss of time that stretches back as far as the eye can see.

And then 500 million years farther.
